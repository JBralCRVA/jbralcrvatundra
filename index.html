<h1>The Tundra</h1>
<p>The Tundra biome is the coldest biome, which means it isn't well suited for human life. Tundra comes from the Finnish word tunturia, 
meaning treeless plain. This biome is known for its low temperatures, little precipitation, and poor nutrients. Dead organic 
material provides the area with most of its nutrients. The two most prominent nutrients in a Tundra is nitrogen and phosphorus. 
There are two different types of Tundras, an Arctic Tundra and an Alpine Tundra.

<h1> Human Activity in the Tundra</h1>
<p> Naitve tribes tend to hunt inside of the Tundra such as the Inuit and Yu'pik in Alaska and Northern Canada. The Tundra is also
being negativily impacted by humans. There is a concern that global warming will release stored carbon dioxide and methane under
the permafrost. The Tundra is also a big tourest attraction is Alaska and Canada for fishing and camping.</p>
